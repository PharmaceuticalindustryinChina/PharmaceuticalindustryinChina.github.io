									<h2>Industry Overview</h2>
									<h3 id="io1" >Custom Segmentation</h3>
<h4>Hospitals in China -- <u><b><i>the primary outlets for distributing pharmaceuticals </i></b></u></h4>

									 
<p style="text-align:justify">Like most countries, there are private and public hospitals. Private hospitals take up more than 60% of the total hospitals. As of February 2019, there had been a total of 33,000 hospitals in China, an increase of 1,866 in the same period of 2018. In the first two months of 2019, there were 550 million patient visits to hospitals in China, up 3.2% year on year. Given that the aging population is on the rise, it is believed that the number of patients would continue to grow and the consumer need towards drugs would be increasing continuously. In general, a 3-tier system is used for public hospitals, namely Primary, Secondary or Tertiary institutions. This indicates that the primary customer of pharmaceutical companies, especially the drug manufacturer, would be hospitals among these three tiers. </p>
<h4>Over-the-counter retail pharmacy -- <u><b><i>the future outlets for distributing pharmaceuticals	</i></b></u></h4>					 
<p style="text-align:justify">As the Chinese have a growing ability to self-medicate, we are expecting an increase in the number of OTC retail pharmacies. Indicating that retail pharmacies would become a more important point of sales to the companies. By the end of 2018, there had been 5,985 drugstore chains in possession of 463,200 retail stores in China, of which 242,560 were chain stores, taking up 52.4% of the total, up by 2 percentage points on an annualized basis; 88.3% of stores were directly run by retailers themselves; 72% were designated medical insurance stores. In China, leading drug retail chains include Yunnan Hongxiang Yixintang Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd, Dashenlin Pharmaceutical Group Co, Ltd, LBX Pharmacy, Yifeng Pharmacy, Sinopharm, China Nepstar Chain Drugstore, Gansu Zhongyou Health Medicine Co, Ltd, Suzhou Quanyi Health Drugstore Chain Co, Ltd, Chongqing Tong Jun Ge Co, Ltd. and Yunnan Jianzhijia Health Drugstore Chain Co, Ltd, among which Chongqing Tong Jun Ge Co, Ltd. has 10,575 drugstores, the most among all retail chains, and Yunnan Hongxiang Yixintang Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd. boasts the largest number of direct-sale stores, numbering 5,758, all of which are directly operated by the company. Securing a tight relationship with the retailers above would be particularly important especially towards the wholesaler, as they have a high market share and one contract might guarantee presence in many shops.  </p>



<h4>Oversea(Export) </h4>					 
<p style="text-align:justify">The exports of pharmaceutical companies have been increasing steadily. (Graph 1) Chinese drugmakers are expected to increase exports and physical presence in higher-reward African countries especially. </p>

		<h3 id="io3" >Overview of China Healthcare Industry</h3>
		<p style="text-align:justify">There are 3 main pillars on the China Healthcare industry where medical services and drugs accounted for most of the total market size, 55% and 37% respectively. Medical Devices only accounts for 8% of total market size of whole China Healthcare Industry.</p>
<span class="image fit"><img src="images/chi.png" alt="" /></span>
		<p style="text-align:justify">China Healthcare Industry is having strong growth potential. The expected growth in the next 3 years: Drugs (~5-10% ), Medical Devices (~15%), Medical Services (~10-15%)
The main driver for the growth comes from the increase in national income, increase in country medical expenses & per capita medical expense. Moreover, there is a changing mindset that people are perceiving healthcare is a necessity. It is also part of the national strategy to ensure the good quality healthcare service in China. </p>

		<h3 id="io4" >Overview of China Drug Industry</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">Drug industry is growing in size without a market ceiling. The YoY growth of total drug sales from 2016 to 2017 is around 7%. It reflects that the growth in drug sales in China is still robust and is expected to continue in the coming years. </p>
<span class="image fit"><img src="images/cd.png" alt="" /></span>
<p style="text-align:justify">Although drug industry is growing, the development of new drugs has been lackluster in China. The new drug as % of total volume is lowest in China when compared with U.S, Japan and Taiwan. New drugs account for 15% of total drugs sales in 2017 in China, expecting the figure to increase to 30% in 2023 and 50% in 2028. It reflects the strong growth potential for the new drugs in China. <br/><br/>
There are several seasons for low new drugs volume. <br/>
1. It is still an early stage of development in China, which lacks technology and expertise.<br/>
2. There is a slow IND/NDA process which makes US/Europe drugs fail to enter China hindering innovation in new drugs. <br/>
3. There is a slow update in China’s medical catalog, affecting rollout of new drugs

									<h2>Industry Value Chain</h2>
									<h3 id="ivc1">The Life of a Drug</h3>
									<p style="text-align:justify">The major life stage of a drug includes Research and development, Raw materials manufacturing, and distribution, shown in the graph below. Along the value chain, the key players include pharmaceutical companies, manufacturers, wholesalers, hospitals, pharmacies, and ultimately delivered to end patients.</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/drug_life.png" alt="" /></span>
									<ol>
										<li ><b><u>Research and Development:</u></b> Initiated with Contract research organizations (CRO), main stages include initial development, preclinical research, and clinical trial</li>
										<li><b><u>Licensing:</u></b> Major steps prior to drug licensing include drug registration, quality control, and labeling.</li>
										<li><b><u>Raw Materials Manufacturing:</u></b> Drug manufacturing includes both imported and local drugs. For imported drugs, most are in finished dosage forms or bulk packets when shipped, while local manufacturers hired are mainly contract manufacturing organizations.</li>
										<li><b><u>Distribution:</u></b> Over the counter (OTC) drugs and prescription drugs are the 2 main categories.</li>
									</ol>
									<br/>
									<h3 id="ivc2">Demystifying Drug R&D and registration</h3>
									<p style="text-align:justify">Developing a new prescription medicine that gains marketing approval is estimated to cost drug makers $2.6 billion on average. The overall chance that a drug entering clinical development will be approved for marketing is just under 12% in China. <br/>(Source: NMPA)</p>

<h2 >Future Trend</h2>
<h3 id="ft1">Trend 1: Regulatory and Policy changes regarding Centralized Procurement </h3>

<p>Price of drugs is drop expected to continue in the future with procurement continue to centralize </p>
<h5>Changes in Procurement Rule</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify">4+7 centralized procurement was initially carried out in the 4 centrally-controlled cities and 7 provincial capitals. With procurement quantity being specified before bidding and negotiation, drug makers need to confirm the exact prices based on the predetermined volume. Some concrete examples include the ancellation of exclusive bidding, and procurement contract has to be shared by up to 3 drug makers.</p>

<h5>Impact</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span class="image right"><img src="images/ft1.png" alt="" /></span>
Centralization of procurement leads to a change in payment mechanism and finally a decline in drug prices.We estimate procurement rules will be optimized gradually as this coverage expansion of centralized procurement will guide future tendering. This would results in a fundamental change as it will take a shorter time for generic drug price to peak given the deteriorating competitive landscape, companies need to focus on strengthening R&D efficiency while increasing the varieties in the pipeline. </p>


<h3 id="ft2">Trend 2: The alternation of National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL)</h3>
<p>The alternation of NRDL would optimize the medical insurance payment, changing the interest and business prospects of some companies.</p>

<h5>Changes in NRDL</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span class="image right"><img src="images/ft2.png" alt="" /></span>
The National Healthcare Security Administration adjusts the NRDL by giving priority to national essential drugs, drugs for major diseases such as cancers and rare diseases, drugs for chronic and pediatric diseases and emergency use drugs. This adjustment saw both additions and deletions, which should put medical insurance funds to more efficient use and optimize the medical insurance payment structure in ways that have a profound influence on industry transformation. </p>
